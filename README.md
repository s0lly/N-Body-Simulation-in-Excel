N-Body Simulation in Excel

This excel file allows you to gain an intuitive understanding of how n-body simulations work in the basic setting of an excel workbook.

I hope this is of help for those trying to learn the basics of astrophysics / orbital mechanics!


Instructions:

First, you need to go to the sheet named "Engine"

Next, you need to press the "START" button

This macro assigns new functionality to the following keys
 - "right arrow key": press this to advance the simulation forward by one timestep
 - "esc": press this to end the simulation and reset all key functionality
NOTE: this macro overrides these key's normal functionality - you must press ESC or press the END button at the end to reenble these keys in excel to their original functionality

The various bodies can be reset to a random spiral-type setting by copy-pasting in the values on the "New Sim Values" tab into the corresponding columns of the "Engine" tab
